This repository contains the code for the analyses I performed during my MSc thesis with the title "Comparison of prospective and retrospective motion correction for Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain". The thesis was carried out at the Neurobiology Research Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital.

The following files define functions used throughout the analyis:

* motion_estimates.py
* recon_register.py
* img_quality_metrics.py
* statistics.py
* utils.py

The respective analyses were performed with the follwoing files:

* analysis_motion_data.py
* analysis_img_quality.py
* analysis_cort_thickness.py

The software package *FreeSurfer* v7.1.1 is used for preprocessing the MR images.
